The systems is comprised by 4 main components:

## Architecture of the system

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **TheaterLink** | Is the backend service. Interacts with the database and provides the API for the frontend. Written in Python using Flask. |
| **TheaterPal** | The main application. Allows users to consult shows, buy tickets, buy food from the cafeteria among other features. Developed with Kotlin |
| **TheaterValid8** | The validation app for the tickets. Reads tickets using NFC from the customers and validates them. Developed with Kotlin |
| **TheaterBite** | The cafeteria terminal app that receives orders from the customers also using NFC. Developed with Kotlin |

### TheaterLink

<!-- TODO: Describe the backend service -->

- To unclutter the main application, [app.py](../TheaterLink/app.py), endpoints were separated into different files. Each file is responsible for a different set of endpoints.

#### User Endpoints

[user.py](../TheaterLink/routes/users.py) contains the endpoints for user management. It allows the creation of new users, login, and user information retrieval.

- API endpoints:
  - `POST /register` - Register a new user
  - `GET /get_user` - Get user information given an ID
  - `GET /users` - Get all users (unused//debugging purposes)

[shows.py](../TheaterLink/routes/shows.py) contains the endpoints for show management. It allows the retrieval of all shows that were previously added to the database (during creation).

- API endpoints:
  - `GET /shows` - Get all shows

[tickets.py](../TheaterLink/routes/tickets.py) contains the endpoints for ticket management. It allows the creation of new tickets, retrieval of all tickets, and ticket validation.

- API endpoints:
  - `POST /purchase_ticket` - Purchase a ticket
    - Request body:

      ```json
      {
        "show_date_id": "int",
        "user_id": "string",
        "num_tickets": "int",
      }
      ```

    - The response will contain the tickets in the following format:

      ```json
      {
        "tickets": [
          {
            "ticketid": "string",
            "userid": "string",
            "date": "string",
            "price": "int",
            "seat": "string",
            "showname": "string"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

    - On top of that, a vouchers array will be returned, as per each ticket that was purchased, a voucher will be generated. The vouchers are in the following format:

      ```json
      {
        "vouchers": [
          {
            "voucherid": "string",
            "vouchertype": "string",
            "userid": "string"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

    - Voucher type are either "free popcorn" or "free coffee", chosen randomly. A 5% voucher discount is also generated if the total price of the tickets is greater than 200.

  - `GET /tickets` - Get all tickets
  - `POST /validate_ticket` - Validate a ticket
  - `POST /set_ticket_as_used` - Set a ticket as used

[vouchers.py](../TheaterLink/routes/vouchers.py) contains the endpoints for voucher management.

- API endpoints:
  - `GET /vouchers` - Get all vouchers for a user

[transactions.py](../TheaterLink/routes/transactions.py) contains the endpoints for transaction management. It allows the retrieval of all transactions and other transaction-related operations.

- API endpoints:
  - `GET /transactions` - Get all transactions
    - The response will contain the transactions in the following format:

      ```json
      {
        "transactions": [
          {
            "timestamp": "timestamp",
            "transactionid": "string",
            "transactiontype": "string",
            "total": "double",
            "vouchers_generated": [
                {
                    "voucherid": "string",
                    "vouchertype": "string",
                    "userid": "string",
                    "isuused": "bool"
                }
            ],
            "items" : [
                // IF TYPE IS TICKET PURCHASE
                {
                    "date": "string",
                    "num_tickets": "int",
                    "price": "double",
                    "shownname": "string",
                },
                // IF TYPE IS FOOD PURCHASE
                {
                    "foodname": "string",
                    "price": "double",
                }
                {}
            ]
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

## Database and Data Schemes

The database used in this project is PostgreSQL and we used the [`psycopg2`](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/) library to interact with it, in the backend service.

We used [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) to host the database.

The database diagram is as follows:

<!-- <p align="center">

<iframe width="100%" height="500px" style="box-shadow: 0 2px 8px 0 rgba(63,69,81,0.16); border-radius:15px;" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" title="Embedded DrawSQL IFrame" frameborder="0" src="https://drawsql.app/teams/carlos-verissimos-team/diagrams/theaterdb/embed"></iframe>

> This could have been avoided by using the `TransactionID` as the foreign key in the `CafeteriaOrderItem` table, but we decided to keep the consistency of the database, even if it meant adding redundancy.
