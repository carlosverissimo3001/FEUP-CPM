## Architecture of the system

| **TheaterLink** | Is the backend service. Interacts with the database and provides the API for the frontend. Written in Python using Flask. |
| **TheaterPal** | The main application. Allows users to consult shows, buy tickets, buy food from the cafeteria among other features. Developed with Kotlin |
| **TheaterValid8** | The validation app for the tickets. Reads tickets using NFC from the customers and validates them. Developed with Kotlin |
| **TheaterBite** | The cafeteria terminal app that receives orders from the customers also using NFC. Developed with Kotlin |

### TheaterLink

<!-- TODO: Describe the backend service -->

- To uncluter the main application, [app.py](../TheaterLink/app.py), endpoints were separated into different files. Each file is responsible for a different set of endpoints.

#### User Endpoints

[user.py](../TheaterLink/routes/users.py) contains the endpoints for user management. It allows the creation of new users, login, and user information retrieval.

- API endpoints:
  - `POST /register` - Register a new user
  - `GET /get_user` - Get user information given an ID
  - `GET /users` - Get all users (unused//debugging purposes)

[shows.py](../TheaterLink/routes/shows.py) contains the endpoints for show management. It allows the retrieval of all shows that were previously added to the database (during creation).

- API endpoints:
  - `GET /shows` - Get all shows

[tickets.py](../TheaterLink/routes/tickets.py) contains the endpoints for ticket management. It allows the creation of new tickets, retrieval of all tickets, and ticket validation.

- API endpoints:
  - `POST /purchase_ticket` - Purchase a ticket
    - Request body:

      ```json
      {
        "show_date_id": "int",
        "user_id": "string",
        "num_tickets": "int",
      }
      ```

    - The response will contain the tickets in the following format:

      ```json
      {
        "tickets": [
          {
            "ticketid": "string",
            "userid": "string",
            "date": "string",
            "price": "int",
            "seat": "string",
            "showname": "string"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

    - On top of that, a vouchers array will be returned, as per each ticket that was purchased, a voucher will be generated. The vouchers are in the following format:

      ```json
      {
        "vouchers": [
          {
            "voucherid": "string",
            "vouchertype": "string",
            "userid": "string"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

    - Voucher type are either "free popcorn" or "free coffee", chosen randomly. A 5% voucher discount is also generated if the total price of the tickets is greater than 200.

  - `GET /tickets` - Get all tickets

            "timestamp": "timestamp",
            "transactionid": "string",
            "transactiontype": "string",
            "total": "double",

                    "userid": "string",
                    "isuused": "bool"
                }
            ],
            "items" : [
                // IF TYPE IS TICKET PURCHASE
                {
                    "date": "string",
                    "num_tickets": "int",
                    "price": "double",
                    "shownname": "string",
                },
                // IF TYPE IS FOOD PURCHASE
                {
                    "foodname": "string",
                    "price": "double",
                }
                {}
            ]
            ]
